\begin{abstract}
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is an 8-m optical ground-based telescope being constructed on Cerro Pachon in Chile. LSST will survey half the sky every few nights in six optical bands. LSST Education and Public Outreach (EPO) is investigating requirements and technologies to create a next generation sky viewer. We discuss and survey current sky viewer technologies and identify new features required for an LSST EPO sky viewer.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
LSST Education and Public Outreach (EPO) reports on the early investigations of using and implementing a skyviewer across its software systems. We researched available open-source skyviewer software and identify requirements and possible features for our implementation. Over the summer we prototyped an implementation of this using Aladin and Aladin-lite (\citet{2014ASPC..485..277B}. Independent of the prototyping we contracted design work and user experience testing from Theresa Neil: Strategy + Design (TNSD)\footnotemark[1] which resulted in user interface features.

\section{Requirements}
The skyviewer has three software engineering requirements.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build on an existing sustainable open-source project.
\item Simple to extend and integrate with existing tools and libraries.
\item Usable in multiple contexts.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation}
Aladin v10.009 and Aladin Lite were used to create a prototype survey with HSC Public Data Release 1 UDEEP data (3.5 sq. deg.) (\citet{2017arXiv170208449A}). This was reprocessed by the LSST DM team using the LSST DM pipeline. It took 16 hours using 8 vCPUs and 16 GB of RAM to process 127 GB of calibrated exposure FITS images across three bands (\emph{i}, \emph{r}, \emph{g}) into 16.7 GB HiPS color PNG image survey (Norder=3,12).
Aladin and Aladin Lite use HEALPix (\citet{2007MNRAS.381..865C}). It is supported in multiple libraries in Python 3, which has seen extensive use at LSST and is used in our Jupyter\footnotemark[2] (\citet{PER-GRA:2007}) science notebook investigations. HiPS\footnotemark[3] and MOC\footnotemark[4], which use HEALPix, are IVOA standards we plan to support. Finally, HEALPix is acceptable for use with the LSST science platform and our formal education teams.

\section{User Interface}

EPO contracted design work and user experience testing from TNSD. Through this user experience testing TNSD identified weaknesses with existing Skyviewer design and iteratively improved the design. The figure \ref{P1-140_fig1} is the result. Some specific features are a gallery, object and detail slider, search, filters and the ability to create collections.

\section{Features}
These design features are identified in figure \ref{P1-140_fig1}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gallery
\item Object slider
\item Detail slider
\item Search
\item Filter
\item Collections
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
EPO plans to implement this as modular open-source software components. Components should be reusable for different audiences through configuration and extension. Components will be used by our portal and science notebook systems. Since our science notebook system will extend the LSST DM science platform\footnotemark[13], our components will be available to LSST scientists.

Though we plan to use Aladin and Aladin Lite, some improvements are required. Aladin Lite and HiPS do not support dynamic image creation using individual bands.
